Linear Regression models to estimate Sales Data using R

Interpreting Simple Regression Model (model1 in code)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)     facebook  
    11.1740       0.2025 
    
The estimated regression line is: Sales=11.174+0.2025*Facebook+e
The intercept(b0) is 11.174 and can be interpreted as the predicted dollar sales value 
for a Facebook advertising budget value of zero. So for a Facebook advertising budget equal 
to zero, we can expect sales of 11.174 *1000 = $11,174.

The regression coefficient(b1) shows that for a Facebook advertising budget equal to 1000 dollars, 
we can expect an increase of 202.5 units (0.2025*1000) in sales 
i.e. Sales = 11.174 + 0.2025*1000 = 56.44 units. This represents a sales of $213,670.
